###  Calculate the severity of an airplane accident :  
    HackerEarth Machine Learning challenge:Calculate the severity of an airplane accident
    we have to build Machine Learning models to anticipate and classify the severity of any airplane accident based on past incidents 
    With this, all airlines, even the entire aviation industry, can predict the severity of airplane accidents                      
    caused due to various factors and, correspondingly, have a plan of action to minimize the risk associated with them.
